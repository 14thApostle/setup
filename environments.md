#### Why Environments?
--- 
Python applications will often use packages and modules that donâ€™t come as part of the standard library. Applications will sometimes need a specific version of a library.

This means it may not be possible for one Python installation to meet the requirements of every application. For example you might needs tensorflow v1 for a particular project but you might need tensorflow version 2 for another one, then the requirements are in conflict.

The solution for this problem is to create a virtual environment, a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.
